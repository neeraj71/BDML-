# Introduction
Present an overview of the problem and the approaches.


# Motivation
What is the problem that the papers are looking at, and why are they looking at
this? 
This is a bit harder for the two introduction lectures, since they try to
overview the area.

# Approaches
Talk a bit about the approaches the papers discussed, and what you found from
your research.

A GFS cluster has multiples clients, one master and multiple chunkservers. Chunkservers store the actual data as Linux files. Files are divided into fixed size (64 Mb) chunks. Chunks are labelled by 64-bit unique global ids (chunk handles). A chunk is by default replicated over 3 chunkservers to attain reliabality. A user can also specify the number of replicas. Master keeps track of which chunks belongs to which files and helps the client to locate the chunks. Master contains a table with keys as file name and values as list of chunk handles. For example, a 1 GB file would be divided into 17 chunks (need to store ids/handle of these 17 chunks). It also contains a table with chunk handles as keys and list of chunkservers holding the corresponding data as values. Since a chunk is replicated over many chunkservers, Master needs to store the mapping from chunk handle to all those chunkservers. This table helps to locate all the replicas of a given chunk handle. The Master contains a version number of each chunk. It also contains info whether a chunk is primary and the lease expiration time. 

Master contains all the metadata in RAM for fast access. However to prevent the data loss on reboot, Master saves the metadata to hard drive (non-volatile memory) except the version number, lease experiment time and table from chunk handle to chunkservers. Because a chunkserver might be dead when master rebooted. Hence, master would not want to send the location of dead chunkservers to clients. Every time master reboots, it would check the health of chunkserver by sending hearbeat messages and reconstructs the mapping. Apart from saving the logs on the disk, Master also create checkpoints in a regular interval of time for the fast reloading afer a crash.

# Trade-Offs
Compare the approaches, discuss when they might be appropriate. For example,
some techniques might only make sense with a lot of data, or in the absence of
multiple tenants, etc.

# Open Questions and Future Work
How are the current trends affecting the area, what are some open questions
about the problem, etc.
